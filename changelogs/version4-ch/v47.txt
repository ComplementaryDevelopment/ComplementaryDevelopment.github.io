Changes over v1.5:
- Improved the reflections even more. Now there should be close to zero false reflections on blocks.
- Added "IntenseTAA" option. Provides near perfect image for screenshots, but not suitable for gameplay.
- Reworked beacons. You can tell that they are one of the most valuable things in the game now.
- Tweaked beacon beams. Especially the colored ones should look better now.
- Slightly tweaked sea lanterns, campfires, torches, sea pickles, magma blocks and redstone torches.
- Fixed extinguished campfires looking too dark.
- Gave Mister Jack o'Lantern even more love.
- Added "Photo Mode" profile. Not suitable for gameplay.
- Changed the Medium (default) preset to not enable subtle distance blur. This should increase the performance by a lot on default settings.
