Changes over v2.8:
- Added actual Rough Reflections using hardcoded normal multipliers (usually about 4 million texels per texture) that change roughness depending on smoothness of the material. Unlike most other methods, it runs pretty fast and produces nearly zero false reflections.
- Added OldPBR as a Material Format option.
- Added "Shadow Brightness" slider to Shadows section in Shader Options. It basically changes ambient lighting intensity during all times.
- Fixed broken shadows/reflections on entities and block entities in Minecraft 1.15 and 1.16. You can disable the fix in Shader Options if you want to.
- Improved the color handling of metals on all material formats.
- Improved some specular maps including Iron/Gold/Prismarine Blocks.
- Improved water reflections (on all water types).
- Improved the lightmaps when using the Compatibility Mode or labPBR or OldPBR or no PBR.
- Added "LiteTAA + FXAA" anti-aliasing option and it's enabled by default instead of FXAA now.
- Added "Disable Foliage Shadows" option to Shadows section in Shader Options.
- Fixed bright lines appearing at the edges of water.
- Fixed changing Shading Strength causing problems with the Compatibility Mode light sources.
- Fixed a problem with transparent textures underwater in Compatibility Mode (Fixes sea plants from "Underwater World" mod)
- Water now casts shadows when "Sunlight Leak Fix" is set to OFF in order to make underwater less broken.
- Added "Dynamic Trees" modded leaves to the block.properties.
- Added "50 ShadeRs of Grey" option to the Colors menu in Shader Options.
- Many other small changes/tweaks here and there.
