Changes over r5.1.1:
- Added "Advanced Colored Lighting" option:
   * Using a custom worldspace flood-fill "mixed" system to overcome the shortcomings seen in most other colored lighting implementations
   * The latest Iris features have been utilized for best performance, so Optifine is not supported with this. Please use Iris
   * Costs very little performance at lower distance settings, and stays faster than comparable colored lighting shaders at any distance
   * Massive thanks to sixthsurge for the base. Check out Photon shaders for a really well made realistic shaderpack
   * Added specific light colors for every light source in the game. Modded lights are not supported for now
   * Added light color tinting functionality to colored stained glass and some other translucent blocks
   * Added custom extra blocklight to all the IntegratedPBR emissives and some extra ones
- Added features that depend on Advanced Colored Lighting being enabled (they depend on ACL voxelization):
   * Added Colored Light Fog which adds 3D volumetric blocklight to the world, most visible in caves and during night
   * Added Connected Glass which removes the borders between adjacent glass blocks for a cleaner look
   * Added a fix for Rain Puddles setting causing puddles to appear in buildings with glass roofs. Enabled if Detail Quality is set to High
   * Added glowing edge effects to nether and end portals
- Added support for the Distant Horizons mod:
   * The latest versions of both Iris and Distant Horizons should be used for this to work
   * Added proper handling for distant chunks to appear similar to normal chunks
   * Added (low quality) reflections to water in distant chunks
   * Added blending functionality to blend distant chunks with normal chunks
   * Tweaked fog to better fit high render distances
   * Many small tweaks and code changes to make the experience less rough
- IntegratedPBR changes:
   * Added pbr properties to Minecraft 1.21 additions
   * Tweaked rain particles to look similar to the rain texture
   * Tweaked lightmap curves for amethyst, trapdoors, deepslate and tuff
   * Slightly increased reflectivity of deepslate and tuff blocks
   * Fixed most particle effects and tweaks not working in newer Minecraft or Iris versions
   * Fixed rain particles causing excessive smudging on rain puddles
   * Fixed Coated Textures having slight issues with waving blocks
   * Fixed small artifacts on redstone comparators and calibrated sculk sensors when Texture Filtering is enabled

- Added Blocklight Intensity setting separate from the colors
- Added a block.properties entry to make any block emissive regardless of PBR

- Slightly tweaked the interaction of skylight and blocklight
- Slightly reduced the emission of armor trims with the Glowing Armor Trim option
- Border Fog now works in vertical direction as well

- Allowed waving blocks to wave in the Nether even if interior waving is disabled
- Lighting in the End dimension now always comes from directly overhead regardless of settings
- Disabled waving leaves in snowy biomes because leaves waving with snow on top look weird
- Color coded Performance Settings and Profiles to better communicate their performance cost
- Changed Ultra and Very High Profiles to incorporate Advanced Colored Lighting
- Rain ambient lighting intensity is now affected by the Brightness slider. The old strength corresponds to 100 Brightness
- Cloud Shadows option now works even if Real-Time Shadows are disabled

- Water Refraction Intensity setting can now be set down to zero
- Water Material Quality setting is now integrated into the Detail Quality setting
- Renamed "TAA Mode" setting to "Temporal Filter"
- Temporal Filter setting can now be set to OFF, and some effects have been tweaked to work a little less bad without it. But it is still highly recommended to keep it enabled

- Fixed bloom looking incorrect at higher screen resolutions
- Fixed light shafts looking a bit too bright behind some translucents
- Fixed Texture Filtering causing the visuals to break in older Minecraft versions
- Fixed Night Nebulae looking incorrect during some nights
- Fixed held items having thin temporal artifacts around them in some cases
- Fixed clouds not blending with the sky correctly with custom atmosphere/cloud color settings. Your custom settings may need to be rebalanced as this changes how cloud colors get modified

- Fixed disabling Border Fog while using "Vanilla" Cloud Style causing an error
- Fixed regular glass looking like it is falling behind when the player/camera is moving
- Fixed rain fog balance being off in some cases
- Fixed chicken feet flickering when the Temporal Filter setting is set to Intense
- Fixed Water Foam Intensity setting not working between 1 and 99
- Fixed incorrect shadows on distant clouds in some rare situations
- Fixed very slight lighting position issues
- Many small changes
