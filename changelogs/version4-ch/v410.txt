Changes over v1.8:
- Made blindness effect match the Vanilla behaviour.
- Added an AO Quality slider and made it scale up with higher profiles. This also fixes a problem with AO on photo mode.
- Fixed/improved end portals+gateways, thanks to fayer3#2332.
- Added bone block speculars.
- End portal frame specular maps have been redone.
- Fixed a weird issue that sometimes occured underwater.
- Fixed an issue regarding Jack o'Lanterns.
- Fixed many things getting too bright near a light source. (Hopper, lever, ladder, glass pane, iron bar, flower pot, end portal frame, chorus plant/flower, all foliage, all rails, repeater and comparator.)
- Improved lightmaps for some blocks. (Water, ice, honey block, slime block and all stained glasses.)
- As always more small tweaks here and there.
