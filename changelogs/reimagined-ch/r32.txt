Changes over r5.6.1:
- Added a fade-in effect for chunks that are loading (Iris version 1.10.3 or above is required)
- Added pixelated "Reimagined" style option for the Rainbows. All thanks to FoZy STYLE
- Added a new light filtering method for Advanced Color Tracing that fixes most light and color leaking issues near block edges. Only enabled when "Detail Quality" is set to "High"
- Added glowing visuals to the Ender Dragon death animation (newer Iris versions are required)
- Added "Blocklight Contrast" setting that adjusts how quickly blocklight fades away as it travels distance away from the light source
- Improved the look of light shafts at sunrise and sunset times
- Improved water absorption and caustic color balance for both Reimagined and Unbound water styles
- Changes regarding World-Space Reflections:
   * Added the "WS Player Reflections" option that allows the main player model to be reflected inside world-space reflections. All thanks to FoZy STYLE for writing the player ray-tracing system and making this possible
   * Added a workaround for world-space reflections looking too grainy in newer Iris versions
   * Improved WSR block texture quality and performance. All thanks to FoZy STYLE
   * Improved the color balance of colored shadows, block lighting, extra ACT lighting, and emission inside world-space reflections to better match the actual terrain
   * Improved accuracy of screen-space reflections when world-space reflections are enabled
   * Held item lighting, cloud shadows, cave lighting, and night vision are now properly reflected in world-space reflections
   * Increased intensity of underwater water reflections when world-space reflections are enabled
   * Reduced the aggressiveness of sky reflection leak prevention in the End dimension when world-space reflections are enabled on newer Minecraft versions
   * Flowing lava, lime carpets and amethyst buds now appear more accurately in world-space reflections
   * Fixed most issues regarding resource packs breaking world-space reflections. Thanks to Kirilpro6284
   * Fixed enabling world-space reflections breaking the shaders on AMD 
   * Fixed world-space reflections having incorrect block lighting in the End dimension in newer Minecraft versions
   * Fixed some of the edge cases where world-space reflections disappeared too early in the distance
   * Fixed some cases where world-space reflections had dotty artifacts
   * Fixed world-space reflections on handheld items glitching in some situations
   * Fixed some small blocks causing flickering in world-space reflections
- IntegratedPBR Changes:
   * Added material reflections to all spear variants, netherite horse armor, glasses of happy ghasts, and all nautilus armor variants
   * Added emission to the eyes of Zombie Nautilus and Parched mobs
   * Added a feature that makes all glass variants look more reflective at a distance to make glass buildings look more realistic, without reducing visibility
   * Added a "Mirror-like Tinted Glass" option that increases reflectivity of Tinted Glass blocks
   * Tweaked the IPBR values of netherite tools, netherite armor, Stray, dripstone, red sand, all red sandstone blocks, daylight detector, and all deepslate blocks
   * Slightly tweaked opacity handling of Glass and Tinted Glass
   * Slightly increased reflectivity of Tinted Glass by default
   * Fixed redstone torches having slightly incorrect emission at some angles
- Added 5 new settings to adjust the behaviour of Temporal Filtering and FXAA in better detail. They replace the previous "Temporal Filter" mode setting
   * Temporal Smoothing: Adjusts the aggressiveness of the smoothing that the Temporal Filter applies. Higher values reduce flickering but increase blur
   * Temporal Jitter: Allows Temporal Filter to better anti-alias the image, but higher values come with more flickering and blurriness
   * Catmull-Rom Sampling: Disabling this option makes Temporal Filter switch to the sampling method used before the r5.5 update which was slightly blurrier
   * "FXAA Strength" and "Reduce FXAA While Moving" settings which are self-explanatory
- Added support for the Colorwheel mod. All thanks to SpacEagle17
- Added support for Fullbright mods. Thanks to SpacEagle17
- Added "Light Shaft Sunset Color" setting that allows tweaking the color of sunrise/sunset light shafts
- Added a slight extra sun glow to the Unbound clouds
- Slightly improved Temporal Filter smoothing consistency. Making distant terrain flicker less while moving, and slightly reducing blurriness on closer objects at the same time
- Increased the brightness of atmospheric fog at noon time
- Reworked the "Shadow Light Multipler" setting to handle higher values in a much better looking way and increased the maximum value
- Rotation of the Reimagined clouds and the direction of all wind effects have been rotated 90 degrees to point towards the south. This improves sunrise/sunset visuals alongside adding more movement to cloud shadows if they are enabled
- Tweaked the look of Reimagined water style when Rain Puddles are active
- Moon Phase Influence settings are now interpolated between the user-defined 3 values into 5 different values when the sun/moon style is set to Reimagined
- Turning off the "Sun/Moon During Rain" option now makes lighting during rain look less contrasty with less noticeable shadows, and also adds a subtle sun/moon glare to the sky
- Rainbows are now visible from underwater and blend correctly behind translucents
- Increased internal quality of light shafts when the Temporal Filter is disabled
- Very slightly reduced sky horizon brightness during noon time
- Very slightly tweaked lighting intensity during rain depending on several conditions and settings
- Very slightly tweaked Advanced Color Tracing calculation for a really tiny performance improvement
- Small emission and light tweaks for the enchanting table
- Removed the skybox detection workaround from newer Iris versions due to it no longer being needed. Thanks to SpacEagle17
- Fixed Texture Filtering not working correctly on leaves after the Minecraft 1.21.11 update
- Fixed Copper Golems holding some light sources resulting in an extreme glow
- Fixed cloud positions stuttering when moving around at very far away from the center of the world
- Fixed a lighting issue that caused streaks of lit sections on leaves
- Fixed lightning bolts not looking correct in newer Minecraft versions. All thanks to SpacEagle17
- Fixed pixelation effects causing artifacts on nametags. Thanks to SpacEagle17
- Fixed reflections in the End dimension getting broken after a while of moving the camera around
- Fixed an issue that sometimes resulted in the world being quickly covered by a dark and thick fog when Advanced Color Tracing is enabled
- Fixed an issue that resulted in some reflections showing more fog than expected
- Fixed glass casting dark shadows with some configurations. Thanks to SpacEagle17
- Fixed chains of hanging signs having incorrect lighting in some situations
- Fixed a sky glare reflection issue inside water
- Fixed a fog color issue during rain inside water
- Fixed Low Cloud Quality option causing clouds to instantly change position when the camera moves through certain coordinates
- Fixed enabling Motion Blur with High Detail Quality causing oceans to look too bright in some conditions
- Fixed the brightness of rainbows being lower than intended when using lower render distance settings
- Fixed three code errors that might have caused issues in the future
- Turning some shader settings off will no longer turn the option color to red unless turning that setting off has potential unforeseen consequences that the user must prepare for
- Stopped the Iris color space setting from changing the colors since it is often changed accidentally by some users
