Changes over r5.5.1:
- Changed the underlying tonemapping function with a Lottes-based custom tonemap:
   * The main improvement with the new tonemap is colors looking softer especially in bright conditions
   * Nearly all light and atmosphere colors have been tweaked and rebalanced to work better with the new tonemap
   * Changes include several color tweaks to materials and other effects
   * Tonemap settings menu has been reworked to work better with the new function
- Added support for the Minecraft 1.21.9 update features:
   * Added support for the new "End flash" effect in the End dimension, but integrated into Complementary's End Beams
   * Added IntegratedPBR reflections to all copper additions, including copper tools, armor, and the copper golem
   * Added colored lighting (Advanced Color Tracing) support for the copper torch and copper lanterns
   * Fixed small issues caused by the update
- Changes related to clouds:
   * Changed Reimagined cloud distribution to use a cloud map based on Vibrant Visuals clouds
   * Significantly increased cloud distance for both Reimagined and Unbound cloud styles.
   * Unbound and Reimagined clouds are now synced between players in the same world that have the same cloud settings (Iris only feature)
   * Altitude of clouds now automatically change in custom worlds that have unusual values (Iris only feature)
   * Increased cloud distance for "vanilla" clouds option for Minecraft 1.21.6 and above to match the vanilla visuals
   * Fixed driver-level forced anisotropic filtering causing Unbound clouds to look broken. Although it is still not recommended to use driver-level forced AF as it can cause texture glitches and bad performance
- Added "World-Space Reflections" option:
   * Makes reflections be able to reflect blocks that aren't currently visible on the screen by reconstructing the world block by block
   * Depends on the "Advanced Colored Tracing" option to be enabled, making the effect Iris exclusive
   * Combined with screen-space reflections to provide maximum total detail, but this can be changed in settings
   * Enabling this setting also comes with more realistic reflection curves for blocks, more realistic sky reflection falloff, and more accurate screen-space reflections
   * Reconstructed scenery have simplified geometry with no labPBR/seuspbr handling, but most IntegratedPBR effects do still work
   * Performance cost is quite high, usually around 15% to 35%, but depends a lot on the scene and shader settings
   * Massive thanks to FoZy STYLE for writing the intricate system that made this possible
- Improved general reflection handling:
   * Improved reflection filtering for much better reflection smoothing and reduce smudging around block edges
   * Tweaked the way block reflections are applied to make reflections look more natural
   * Tweaked reflections on entities and held items to look closer to regular block reflections
   * All non-water or world-space reflections are now rendered in half resolution for performance gains. This optimization can be disabled in material settings but the visual difference isnt that noticeable in most cases
   * Regular blocks behind translucents (e.g. ocean floor when viewed from outside of the ocean) no longer have reflections. This increases performance in some scenarios that are unusually heavy
   * Big thanks to gri573 for doing reflection code restructuring and writing resolution controllable reflections
- Changes related to IntegratedPBR:
   * Tweaked the reflectiveness of cobblestone and some related blocks to look less harsh
   * Reduced reflectiveness of planks and wet farmland
   * Fixed cherry slab and stairs having incorrect material properties
   * The "IPBR+ Compatibility Mode" setting now simplifies froglight emission as well
- Added more options for the "Night Star Amount" setting. Thanks to BlueGradientHorizon
- Improved labPBR/seuspbr reflectivity balance for metals and high-f0 materials
- Tweaked TAA to reduce the amount of artifacts around entities, held items and particles
- Tweaked subsurface scattering on leaves to reduce the edge lighting issues
- The "Ultra" profile now has "World-Space Reflections" enabled, making it even more intensive than before
- "Advanced Colored Lighting" setting is now called "Advanced Color Tracing"
- "Entity Shadows" setting now has "OFF", "Regular Entities", and "Full" options
- "Entity Shadows" setting is now set to "Regular Entities" for "High" and above Profiles
- The look and distribution of End Beams no longer depend on the Render Distance
- The "Ore Glow Strength" setting now affects colored lighting intensity as well
- Quality of Motion Blur now change with the Detail Quality setting. Previous quality level can be achieved at "High" Detail Quality
- Adjusted the internal quality of each Real-Time Shadows step with foliage getting more samples than other blocks
- All shader settings that impact performance are now colored yellow aside from the ones in the main "Performance Settings" menu
- Increased blocklight brightness on particles
- Reduced the emission on all glowing things under daytime skylight
- Tweaked TAA on Distant Horizons chunks to reduce flickering when standing still
- Fixed end dimension colors being stuck at ender dragon fight mode in newer Minecraft versions. Thanks to SpacEagle17
- Fixed color banding caused by the vignette effect
- Fixed some lights being able to pass through tinted glass when Advanced Color Tracing is enabled
- Fixed "Heavy & Colder" rain style causing a bright fog issue underwater
- Fixed lighting issues near block edges when the Pixelated Shadows option is enabled
- Fixed Pixelated Blocklight option not affecting held lighting
- Fixed firefly bushes having broken waving animation in some situations
- Fixed beacon beams not fading properly when viewed in front of some sky effects
- Fixed beacon beams appearing very short in the nether with the Distant Horizons mod
- Fixed Scene Aware Light Shafts behaving a bit differently when the "Connected Glass" ACT Feature is active
- Fixed "Connected Glass" ACT Feature causing glass shadows to look broken with some resource packs
- Fixed a reflection issue regarding picked up items and modded entities
- Fixed shadows cutting off too early even when the Shadow Distance setting is set way beyond Render Distance
- Fixed shadow glitches near the edges of blocks when using some PBR resource packs with Sun Angle set to 0
- Updated Complementary License Agreement. Mostly for clarification reasons
- Several small or unimportant changes
