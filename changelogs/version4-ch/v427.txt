Changes over v3.03:
- Reworked atmospheric fog. It's now altitude based, looks more atmospheric and is much more apparent.
- Fixed compatibility with Intel GPUs. (Thank you so much Capt)
- Improved water reflection accuracy.
- Tweaked sunrise/sunset lighting to be warmer.
- Tweaked sunrise/sunset color timings to watch the vanilla ones.
- Improved night sky colors.
- Sky/fog/water colors are now mixed with vanilla sky/fog/water colors by set percentages. This means added compatibility with sky/fog/water color changing modifications.
- Added sliders to (separately) change the vanilla sky, fog and water color influence percentages.
- Added support for entities with the glowing status effect. (Can be disabled in the Workarounds section in Debug/Other)
- Added "Blocklight Flickering" option.
- Added "Half" Promo Outline Mode that disables the black outline part of the Promo Outline.
- Added a slider for underwater brightness.
- Tweaked rain lighting.
- Tweaked Light Shafts.
- Tweaked cloud distribution.
- Fixed clouds forming a line where they disappear.
- Fixed end gateway beams being incorrectly colored without ComplementaryResources.
- Fixed Parallax Occlusion Mapping causing fps drops even with ComplementaryResources.
- Normalmap related effects are now enabled by default with the High profile.
- Fixed world border not being visible unless the player is very close to it.
- Fixed endermen glowing in older Minecraft versions when PBR is on.
- Fixed fog color not getting affected by the void darkening.
- Enabling "Force Water Waves" now also enables waving water itself.
- Tried to add support for The Betweenlands. (Not complete, and The Betweenlands shaders must be turned off in the config)
- Many more tweaks here and there.
