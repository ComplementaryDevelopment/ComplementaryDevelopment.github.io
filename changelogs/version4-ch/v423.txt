Changes over v2.9:
- Changed the installation paths, because of the following two things:
- Added auto-dedection for ComplementaryResources. If you're not using it, the shader will automatically switch to labPBR.
- Merged Fast Compatibility Mode with the Compatibility Mode. There is only one Compatibility Mode now, and it's the fastest profile.
- Fixed stuttering issues and high VRam usage. This was done by switching to a way better method of disabling mipmap levels on problematic textures.
- Improved sunlight/moonlight handling. Light now smoothly transitions between sun/moon in the morning/evening.
- Added ambient occlusion support (affected by light levels) to labPBR material format.
- Improved normal map handling (switched to the proper method) on labPBR material format.
- Reworked atmospheric fog intensities.
- Added specular maps for netherite armor.
- Improved specular maps of Iron Block and Redstone Lamps.
- Added emissives to Blaze Rod, Blaze Powder, Brewing Stand, Magma Cream, Eye of Ender and Fire Charge.
- Improved brightness and opacity for all particles.
- Improved translucent handling in Compatibility Mode.
- Fixed water looking brighter than usual in some situations (again).
- Fixed nether being too dark on any Minecraft version below 1.16.
- Added "Force Distance Blur in Nether" and "Nether Distance Blur Strength" options to the DOF/Distance Blur menu.
- Added "Force Water Waves" option to the Water menu. Enabling it makes waves appear on Vanilla and RTX-ish water types.
- Tweaked enchantment glint brightness.
- Fixed underwater fog being broken especially on low render distances.
- Some other changes/tweaks/fixes here and there.
