Changes over v1.3:
- Tweaked the bloom tiles to complement per pixel emissives.
- End rods, magma blocks, glowstones and campfires have been improved.
- Made blazes', phantoms' and withers' eyes emissive.
- Made sea pickles' bright bits emissive since sea pickles emit light in this game.
- Slightly reduced the brightness of sunrises and sunsets.
- Slightly changed the water config.
- Added an easter egg, because why not.
- Removed Waving Fire/Water/Lava options as they are prone to bugs.
